# Weather-ETL-Project
This project demonstrates a basic ETL pipeline setup that retrieves weather data from the OpenWeather API for Lagos, Nigeria. The data is extracted, transformed, and then loaded into an Amazon S3 bucket. The pipeline is orchestrated using Apache Airflow running on an EC2 instance. IAM roles are used for secure access to the S3 bucket.
